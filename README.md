# CoreData API service for AngularJS

An AngularJS service for the CoreData API

## Dependencies
The service uses npm to install dependencies for tests and to run them.

To install dependencies simply run the following command in the root of the project

```
npm install
```

## Tests
To run the tests, simply run the following npm command

``` 
npm test
```

This will run all the tests once. To have the karma test runner watch the service and tests and rerun tests on each change, simply run

```
npm run test-watch
```
